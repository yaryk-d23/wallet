You agree to: (a) provide accurate, current and complete information when creating the account; (b) maintain and promptly update your Account information to keep it accurate, complete, and current; (c) maintain the security and confidentiality of your login credentials and restrict access to your Account and your computer; (d) promptly notify Karbo.me if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to the Site; and (e) take responsibility for all activities that occur under your Account and accept all risks of unauthorized access.</span></p><h2 class="c3" id="h.nc8pznjtyvz8"><span class="c2">PRIVACY POLICY</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information about how we collect, use, and share your personal information.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c3" id="h.g662yvytljbm"><span class="c2">CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION OVER THE INTERNET</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The transmission of data or information (including communications by e-mail) over the Internet or other publicly accessible networks is not one hundred percent secure, and is subject to possible loss, interception, or alteration while in transit. Accordingly, Karbo.me does not assume any liability, without limitation, for any damage you may experience or costs you may incur as a result of any transmissions over the Internet or other publicly accessible networks, including but not limited to transmissions involving the Services or e-mail with Karbo.me containing your personal information. While Karbo.me will take commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of the information you provide to Karbo.me and will treat such information in accordance with Karbo.me&#39;s Privacy Policy, in no event will the information you provide to Karbo.me be deemed to be confidential, create any fiduciary obligations for Karbo.me, or result in any liability for Karbo.me in the event that such information is negligently released by Karbo.me or accessed by third parties without Karbo.me&#39;s consent.</span></p><h2 class="c3" id="h.oq2lbn7hchq9"><span class="c2">CRYPTOCURRENCY TRANSACTIONS</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karbo.me cannot and does not guarantee the value of cryptocurrency. You acknowledge and agree that the value of cryptocurrency is highly volatile and that buying, selling, and holding cryptocurrency involves a high risk. Additionally, the cryptocurrency consensus network is solely responsible for verifying and confirming proposed transactions that you submit via the Services, and Karbo.me cannot and does not confirm, cancel, or reverse cryptocurrency-to-cryptocurrency transactions, other than confirmation of the cryptocurrency network&rsquo;s completion of a transaction.</span></p><h2 class="c3" id="h.77kh2umc1696"><span class="c2">NO CANCELLATIONS OR MODIFICATIONS</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The cryptocurrency network is operated by a decentralized network of independent third parties. Once a transaction request has been submitted to the cryptocurrency network via the Services, the cryptocurrency network will automatically complete or reject the request and you will not be able to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction request. You acknowledge and agree that Karbo.me is not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any cryptocurrency transaction initiated via the Services. The Services help you submit your cryptocurrency transaction request for confirmation to the cryptocurrency network. However, Karbo.me has no control over the cryptocurrency network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction request you submit via the Services will be completed. You acknowledge and agree that the transaction requests you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the cryptocurrency network. When you complete a transaction request via the Services, you authorize us to submit your transaction request to the cryptocurrency network in accordance with the instructions you provide via the Services.</span></p><h2 class="c3" id="h.p290uacbvcnu"><span class="c2">ACCURACY OF INFORMATION </span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You acknowledge and agree that Karbo.me is not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Cryptocurrency transaction initiated via the Services. For instance, if you mistype a wallet address or otherwise provide incorrect information in connection with any transaction request to send Cryptocurrency via the Service, the Cryptocurrency will be sent to whatever wallet address or information you provide. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction request details carefully before completing any transaction requests via the Services.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karbo.me process Cryptocurrency Transaction according to the instructions received from its users and we do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, requestee or other party. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to Karbo.me as the relevant Cryptocurrency Transaction may not be cancelled or reversed once initiated. </span></p><h2 class="c3" id="h.motub4xg58gx"><span class="c2">51% AND OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCY ATTACKS </span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karbo.me makes every commercially reasonable attempt to help prevent and mitigate cryptocurrency attacks. If Karbo.me is able to confirm that a cryptocurrency active on the Services has been compromised or is under attack, Karbo.me may immediately halt deposits and withdrawals for Cryptocurrency. If it is determined that such an attack caused the Cryptocurrency to greatly decrease in value, Karbo.me may discontinue activity on such Cryptocurrency entirely. Resolutions concerning deposits, withdrawals, and user balances for an attacked Cryptocurrency will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Karbo.me makes no representation and does not warrant the safety of the Services and is not liable for any lost value or stolen property, whether or not Karbo.me was negligent in providing the proper security.</span></p><h2 class="c3" id="h.2krfqlfizuhf"><span class="c2">REFUND POLICY </span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Given the irreversibility of cryptocurrency transactions, we cannot provide refund or return on any transaction or exchange order. </span></p><h2 class="c3" id="h.2ywersoiw9b9"><span class="c2">LIMITED LICENSE </span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Karbo.me grants you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable license, subject to these Terms, to access and use the Services, and the content, materials, information and functionality available in connection therewith (collectively, the &ldquo;Content&rdquo;) solely for information, transactional, or other approved purposes as permitted by Karbo.me from time to time.
